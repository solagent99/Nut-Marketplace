    <p>Introduction</p>
<p>Welcome to Nut Market, a service provided by PARADICE Inc., doing business as Nut Market ("Nut </p>
<p>Market," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding </p>
<p>agreement that governs your access to and use of the Nut Market services, including but not limited to </p>
<p>our website(s), APIs, mobile applications ("App"), and any related support, software, tools, features, or </p>
<p>functionalities. These services enable you to interact with non-fungible tokens ("NFTs") on public </p>
<p>blockchains, including viewing, exploring, displaying, creating, minting, purchasing, selling, or </p>
<p>transferring NFTs.</p>
<p>"You" or "your" refers to you, the user of the Service. If you represent an entity, these terms encompass</p>
<p>both you and the entity, and you declare that you are authorized to bind the entity to these Terms.</p>
<p>Important Legal Acknowledgment</p>
<p>Please read these Terms attentively as they contain crucial legal obligations and affect your legal rights.</p>
<p>Notably, Section 16 contains a mandatory arbitration agreement and class action waiver, requiring </p>
<p>disputes to be settled through individual arbitration rather than in court.</p>
<p>Your acceptance and use of the Service constitute an agreement to these Terms. If you disagree with </p>
<p>any part of these Terms, you should not access or use the Service.</p>
<p>Nature of Nut Market's Role</p>
<p>Nut Market is not a financial institution, broker, dealer, creditor, or regulated entity. We provide a peer-</p>
<p>to-peer platform facilitating interaction between users and NFTs on public blockchains. Nut Market </p>
<p>does not have custody or control over NFTs or blockchains, nor do we handle NFT transactions.</p>
<p>Nut Market is not a party to any user agreements. You are responsible for verifying the identity and </p>
<p>legitimacy of NFTs purchased via our Service. We make no representations regarding the authenticity </p>
<p>or legality of users or NFTs.</p>
<p>Additional terms may apply to certain services, which will form part of your agreement with us. We </p>
<p>may revise these Terms, and continued use of the Service signifies acceptance of revised Terms.</p>
